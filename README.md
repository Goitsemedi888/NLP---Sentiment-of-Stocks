# NLP--- From Tweets to Trades: AI-Powered Bitcoin Sentiment & Market Timing" "₿"

## Motivation & Industry Relevance

As large financial institutions — from JPMorgan to Morgan Stanley — increasingly embrace crypto services (custody, tokenization, stablecoins, etc.), there’s growing demand for tools that:

- Assess sentiment and detect whether it *leads* or *lags* market moves  
- Combine social data + financial signals into quantifiable strategies  
- Operate with reliable pipelines, robust risk metrics, backtesting over varied market regimes  

This project is built with that real-world imperative in mind. It is not just an academic exercise — it's engineered toward deployment: modular, tested, and designed with execution & risk in mind.

Natural Language Processing $entiment of Stocks

##Introduction

Social media has always been a great way to gauge public opinion on a variety of topics. In recent years, it has also become an important tool for investors. Twitter, for example, is a general purpose social media platform that allows users to share their thoughts on various ideas inclusive of the cryptomarket in real-time. This gives investors a valuable window into how the public is feeling about a particular crypto. In addition, Twitter can also be used to identify social media influencers who have the ability to move markets. As such, twitter provides a valuable service for both individual and professional investors. Crypto-currency especially is labeled as the stock for the masses, with easily accessible investing applications such as Coinbase and Robinhood.
Whether it is celebrities tweeting a particular statement that rallies individuals to purchase a cryptocurrency, or a group of individuals deciding to formulate a plan to artificially raise the value of a coin, one thing that is certain is social media is quite impactful. While this can be used for good, it can also lead to a volatile market that is difficult to predict and can lead individuals to be completely unsure of where to place their money. 

##Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously difficult to predict. Even the most experienced investors can have trouble anticipating market behavior. The volatile and complex nature of cryptocurrencies makes them notoriously difficult to model. However, we believe that deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can potentially provide more accurate predictions. In our project, we will be customizing a model built on a pre-trained CNN model and Transformers to build models that predict the sentiment of text and relates that to the  behavior of cryptocurrency markets. 

The objective of our project is to design a model that utilizes AI to predict the behavior of cryptocurrency markets, in this context specifically Bitcoin; based on the sentiment of crowds on social media, in this case specifically Twitter. Our suite of tools will be trained on a dataset of past social media data and market data. Once trained, it will be able to automatically detect market trends and make predictions accordingly. Ideally our model will have the potential to surpass previous results and provide accurate predictions of Bitcoin market behavior.
##Challenges

A unique challenge with the corpus we will be utilizing is the specialized lingo and sarcastic undertones in Tweets. Each subreddit can almost be thought of as its own civilization, which forms its own unique terminology, inside jokes, etc. One thing we will need to ensure is that our sentiment analysis model takes into account sarcasm as it can interpret a statement like “I am so happy to lose money” incorrectly depending on the training. Additionally the model will need to be trained on a custom dictionary that includes common Reddit and Twitter slang that isn’t available in the traditional English dictionary, at the very least a mapping of a slang term to a traditionally understood term needs to exist. 
Another challenge more related to an ethical aspect is that individuals on Twitter and Reddit are not all guaranteed to have the credibility of financial advisers, in fact a majority are not. This is why we will need to rely on a more wisdom of crowds approach in which the more people are supporting a stock with a positive sentiment the more supported it is, we cannot put too heavy of a weight on individuals. 
And lastly, a general challenge when dealing with crypto  markets is the volatility of the market due to underlying factors unrelated to the individuals contributing to it. We’ve already seen stocks plummet due to economic crises, pandemics, housing markets, etc. And it is never a constant plummet for each market. For instance there can be a moment in time where the technological sector is performing incredibly poorly, but the housing construction market is doing well. For this sort of challenge a few approaches can be implemented, either an individual focus on stocks, in which one stock is observed over time, or varying weights placed in the training model based on knowledge that we have of the market over time. Basically, labeling a certain time as a “bad market” period and accounting for that in the model. 

##Related Works

There has certainly been a variety of work based around emotion and stock market performance that should be recognized. Research has been done on general emotional theory and its relation to the stock market, Ingrami presents the concept that while it is assumed stock traders make decisions based on rational reasoning, in reality there is a heavy psychological influence of emotion that affects their trades, and that emotions are based on subconscious beliefs that are triggered by some form of event. This feeds into our hypothesis on social media playing a major factor into stock trading because it is an environment that heavily feeds off of emotional vulnerability. In the context of artificial intelligence, various experiments have been conducted in implementing deep learning algorithms for stock prediction. Chunii et al developed an emotional based stock system that focuses on individual investor emotion. This ties into what we are working on as they implement sentiment analysis, but one thing we want to focus on is the information we can gather from social media directly. This is where the work of Mehtaiii et al comes in. In their research they implement a similar approach of utilizing social media like twitter as well as stock websites to predict the stock market, we will definitely be referencing this data, but one thing we will add to ensure originality is Reddit as a source of social media data, as well as explore the world of cryptocurrency and its patterns.

Sentiment analysis is a challenging task due to a variety of factors. As Patil and Lokisha iv
notes, The Information extracted on the Web during opinion collection involves data in the form of words, sentences and documents associated with various polarities. The primary task of sentiment analysis is to determine the polarity with classification for a given word, phrase, sentence and documents etc. There are varied numbers of challenge in the area of sentiment 
analysis. At one state/ locality is considered to be positive or in other state to be negative as first 
challenge. A second challenge is that the people never may or may not express the same opinions. Moreover, understanding the context in which an opinion was expressed can also be challenging since opinions are often based on individual experiences. As such, sentiment analysis requires sophisticated algorithms and technologies to accurately interpret and categorize data. In addition, natural language processing techniques must be used to identify nuances in language that could affect the polarity of a statement or document. Ultimately, modern sentiment analysis methods must be employed to help identify patterns in datasets so as to draw useful conclusions about public opinion. 

The paper “The neglected cohort: the impact of silent majority in social media on stock returns” authored by Wen Longa and Yanqiang Zhong v also contributes to getting a better understanding of the effect of social media on stock returns and the market in general. An interesting scientific challenge this paper attempts to address is that the population of interest here is actually a very silent population, which also means isn’t as much obvious data available. This creates an interesting dilemma for machine learning, as machine learning in general is quite a data-hungry task, which is what encouraged us to scrape our own data on top of utilizing the preexisting sets.
